# Face Detection and Recognition System

Welcome to the **Face Detection and Recognition System**! This Python-based project utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to detect, label, and recognize faces in images and video streams.

## Features

<ol>
  <li>Face Detection: Accurately locates faces within images or video streams using sophisticated algorithms.</li>
  <li>Face Labeling: Automatically assigns labels to detected faces based on predefined identifiers.</li>
  <li>Face Recognition: Matches detected faces against a database of known faces to verify or identify individuals.</li>
  <li>Real-time Processing: Supports real-time face detection and recognition for live video feeds.</li>
</ol>

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV:** For face detection and image processing.
- **face_recognition:** For extracting face embeddings and performing recognition tasks.
- **dlib:** For advanced face detection and facial landmarks detection.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keijax/Face-Detection.git
cd Face-Detection
pip install opencv-python face_recognition dlib
